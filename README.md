# moz-bounce-balls

This is a small project i did when I learned JavaScript.
The original tutorial is on :

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_building_practice

  I have upgraded it a little bit by adding a homepage in which the player can choose the number of the balls 
that appear on the screen.

You have to catch the balls with the user-controlled evil circle.
